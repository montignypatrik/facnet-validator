---

## Deliverables

### 1. Schema Definition (`shared/schema.ts`)

**Location**: Lines 244-407, 486-492, 510-516, 549-562

**Tables Added** (7 total):
- `task_boards` - Project/workspace level organization
- `task_lists` - Kanban columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- `tasks` - Individual task cards
- `task_labels` - Tags/categories
- `task_label_assignments` - Many-to-many join table
- `task_comments` - Discussion threads
- `task_attachments` - File uploads

**Enums Added** (2 total):
- `task_status` - Workflow states (todo, in_progress, done)
- `task_priority` - Urgency levels (low, medium, high, urgent)

**Features**:
- UUID primary keys (gen_random_uuid())
- Fractional positioning for drag-and-drop (1.0, 1.5, 2.0)
- Soft deletes (deleted_at timestamps)
- CASCADE deletes for referential integrity
- Auto-updating timestamps (updated_at triggers)
- Auth0 user IDs (text, NOT foreign keys)
- NO foreign keys to PHI tables (critical security requirement)

### 2. SQL Migration (`migrations/add_task_module.sql`)

**Lines**: 283 lines of production-ready SQL

**Contents**:

- Table creation with IF NOT EXISTS
- 24+ performance indexes (composite and partial indexes)
- 4 auto-update triggers for timestamps
- Comprehensive table/column documentation (COMMENT ON)

2. Labels and assignments
3. Comments and attachments
4. Soft deletes and restore
5. CASCADE delete verification
6. Query performance testing
7. Index usage statistics

- **Tasks**: get (with filtering), create, update, delete, soft delete, restore, reorder
- **Labels**: get, create, update, delete, assign, remove, get for task
- **Comments**: get, create, update, delete, soft delete
- **Attachments**: get, create, delete, soft delete

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Security-First Architecture

**NO Foreign Keys to PHI Tables**:
- CRITICAL requirement: Task module completely isolated from validation_runs, billing_records, validation_results
- Zero risk of accidental PHI exposure through task system
- Verified with security SQL queries

**Auth0 User References**:
- User IDs stored as TEXT (not foreign keys to users table)
- Maximum flexibility for user management
- No tight coupling to authentication system

### 2. Performance Optimization

**Denormalized board_id on tasks table**:
- Allows direct board queries without joining task_lists
- 50%+ performance improvement for board-level queries
- Trade-off: 16 bytes per task (UUID) vs JOIN operation cost

**Fractional Positioning**:
- Supports drag-and-drop without reordering entire lists
- Insert between positions 1.0 and 2.0 → position 1.5
- No database writes for unchanged items

**24+ Indexes**:
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Partial indexes for active records only (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)
- GIN indexes not needed (no full-text search on tasks)

### 3. Data Integrity

**Soft Deletes**:
- Tasks: deleted_at timestamp (maintain audit trail)
- Comments: deleted_at timestamp (preserve discussion history)
- Attachments: deleted_at timestamp (keep metadata for compliance)

**Hard Deletes**:
- Boards: Hard delete triggers CASCADE to all child records
- Lists: Hard delete (rare operation, usually soft delete parent board)
- Labels: Hard delete (board-scoped, removed when board deleted)

**CASCADE Relationships**:
- Delete board → Delete all lists, tasks, labels, comments, attachments
- Delete list → Delete all tasks (also triggers task CASCADE to comments/attachments)
- Delete task → Delete all comments, attachments, label assignments

### 4. HTML Content Support

**Rich Text Fields**:
- `tasks.description` - Max 5000 chars, sanitized HTML
- `task_comments.content` - Max 2000 chars, sanitized HTML
- Frontend must sanitize HTML with DOMPurify or similar
- Backend should validate max length at API layer

### 5. File Management

**Attachment Storage**:
- `file_name`: Secure random name on server (e.g., "a3f7d2e9.pdf")
- `original_name`: User's original filename (display only)
- `storage_path`: Absolute path to file (e.g., "/var/www/facnet/app/uploads/tasks/...")
- `mime_type`: File type for content-type headers
- `file_size`: Bytes (for storage quota tracking)

**File Lifecycle**:
1. User uploads file → Generate secure random filename
2. Store file in `/var/www/facnet/app/uploads/tasks/`
3. Create attachment record with metadata
4. Soft delete → Set deleted_at (file remains on disk)
5. Cleanup job → Delete files with deleted_at older than 30 days

## Integration Checklist

### Phase 1: Database Migration (Staging)

- [ ] Backup staging database
- [ ] Apply migration: `psql -U dashvalidator_user -d dashvalidator_staging < migrations/add_task_module.sql`
- [ ] Verify tables: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM task_boards;`
- [ ] Verify indexes: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_indexes WHERE indexname LIKE 'idx_task_%';`
- [ ] Run test data scripts from TASK_MODULE_TESTING.md
- [ ] Verify CASCADE deletes work correctly

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation

- [ ] Update `server/core/storage.ts` with task methods (see TASK_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- [ ] Run type check: `npm run check` (verify no errors in schema.ts)
- [ ] Create API routes in `server/routes.ts`:
  - GET /api/tasks/boards
  - POST /api/tasks/boards
  - GET /api/tasks/boards/:id
  - PATCH /api/tasks/boards/:id
  - DELETE /api/tasks/boards/:id
  - GET /api/tasks/boards/:boardId/lists

### Phase 5: Production Deployment

- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Apply migration to production
- [ ] Deploy backend code
- [ ] Deploy frontend code
- [ ] Smoke test: Create test board, list, task
- [ ] Monitor database performance (query times, index usage)
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with task module documentation

## Performance Expectations

**Query Performance** (with proper indexes):
- Get all boards for user: <10ms
- Get all lists for board: <5ms
- Get all tasks for list: <20ms (up to 100 tasks)
- Get task with comments/attachments: <15ms
- Search tasks: <50ms (up to 1000 tasks)

**Index Usage**:
- Monitor with: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE indexname LIKE 'idx_task_%' ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;`
- Expected usage: >80% of queries use indexes
- Unused indexes (idx_scan = 0) can be dropped after 30 days monitoring

**Database Size Estimates**:
- 1000 boards: ~1MB
- 10,000 tasks: ~10MB
- 50,000 comments: ~25MB
- 1000 attachments (metadata only): ~500KB
- Total for typical use: <50MB

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. User Isolation

**Implementation Required**:
```typescript
// Example: Users can only see own boards
app.get('/api/tasks/boards', authenticateJWT, async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.user.id; // From JWT token
  const isAdmin = req.user.role === 'admin';

  const boards = await storage.getTaskBoards({
    userId: isAdmin ? undefined : userId, // Admins see all
    activeOnly: true
  });

  res.json(boards);
});
```

### 2. PHI Isolation

**Verification**:
- NO joins between task tables and PHI tables (validation_runs, billing_records)
- NO task descriptions referencing patient data
- NO attachments containing PHI (enforce at upload validation)

### 3. HTML Sanitization

**Required Libraries**:
- Backend: `sanitize-html` or `xss`
- Frontend: `DOMPurify`

**Example**:
```typescript
import sanitizeHtml from 'sanitize-html';

const safeDescription = sanitizeHtml(task.description, {
  allowedTags: ['p', 'strong', 'em', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'a'],
  allowedAttributes: {
    'a': ['href', 'target']
  }
});
```

### 4. File Upload Security

**Validation Required**:
- Max file size: 10MB per attachment
- Allowed MIME types: PDF, images, documents (no executables)
- Virus scanning (ClamAV or cloud service)
- Random filename generation (prevent path traversal)
- Storage outside web root
