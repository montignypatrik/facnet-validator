# Phase 4 & 5 Backend Implementation Summary

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-14
**Implemented By:** API Engineer (ai-agent)
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 4 (Resilience & Recovery) and Phase 5 (Advanced Features) backend improvements for the Quebec healthcare billing validator module.

The implementation enhances the validation queue infrastructure with intelligent retry logic, dead letter queue management, job cancellation, live preview capabilities, and batch processing support.

---

## Phase 4: Resilience & Recovery

### Task 4.1: Enhanced Retry Configuration

**File:** `server/queue/validationQueue.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- Increased retry attempts from 3 to 5 for better resilience
- Updated `removeOnFail` to `false` to keep failed jobs for analysis (DLQ handles cleanup)
- Maintained exponential backoff starting at 2 seconds

```typescript
defaultJobOptions: {
  attempts: 5, // Increased from 3 for better resilience
  backoff: {
    type: 'exponential',
    delay: 2000, // Start with 2 seconds
  },
  removeOnFail: false, // Keep failed jobs for analysis
}
```

**Rationale:** More retry attempts reduce false negatives from transient errors while preserving failed jobs enables post-mortem analysis.

---

### Task 4.2: Dead Letter Queue System

**File:** `server/queue/validationQueue.ts`

**New Functions:**
1. `getDeadLetterQueue()` - Creates/retrieves the DLQ instance
2. `moveToDeadLetter(jobId, reason)` - Transfers failed jobs to DLQ with full context

**Key Features:**
- Failed jobs preserved for 30 days in DLQ
- Stores original job ID, data, failure reason, attempts, and timestamp
- Enables debugging and analysis of persistent failures

```typescript
export async function moveToDeadLetter(jobId: string, reason: string): Promise<void> {
  const queue = getValidationQueue();
  const job = await queue.getJob(jobId);

  if (!job) return;

  const dlq = getDeadLetterQueue();
  await dlq.add('failed-validation', {
    originalJobId: jobId,
    data: job.data,
    failedReason: reason,
    attempts: job.attemptsMade,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }, {
    removeOnComplete: { age: 86400 * 30 } // Keep for 30 days
  });
}
```

**Rationale:** DLQ provides a safety net for jobs that cannot be processed, enabling later analysis and potential replay without data loss.

---

### Task 4.3: Retry Logic Enhancement

**File:** `server/queue/validationWorker.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced `failed` event handler to check retry attempts
- Automatically moves jobs to DLQ when all retries exhausted
- Comprehensive logging for retry attempts and DLQ transfers

```typescript
worker.on('failed', async (job: Job<ValidationJobData> | undefined, error: Error) => {
  if (!job) return;

  const attemptsMade = job.attemptsMade || 0;
  const maxAttempts = job.opts.attempts || 3;

  console.error(`[WORKER] Job ${job.id} failed (attempt ${attemptsMade}/${maxAttempts}):`, error.message);

  // If all retries exhausted, move to dead letter queue
  if (attemptsMade >= maxAttempts) {
    console.log(`[WORKER] Moving job ${job.id} to dead letter queue after ${attemptsMade} attempts`);
    await moveToDeadLetter(job.id!, error.message);
  }
});
```

**Rationale:** Intelligent retry logic ensures jobs are retried appropriately before being moved to DLQ, reducing manual intervention.

---

### Task 4.4: PM2 Configuration Enhancement

**File:** `ecosystem.config.cjs`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `restart_delay: 4000` for 4-second delay between restarts
- Enhanced resilience settings documentation
- Maintained existing zero-downtime reload configuration

```javascript
// Enhanced process management for better resilience
min_uptime: '10s',           // Minimum uptime before considered online
max_restarts: 10,            // Maximum number of restarts
restart_delay: 4000,         // Wait 4 seconds between restarts
kill_timeout: 5000,          // Wait 5s for graceful shutdown (SIGTERM)
wait_ready: true,            // Wait for app.listen() before considering process online
listen_timeout: 10000,       // Max wait time for app to be ready
```

**Rationale:** Restart delay prevents rapid restart loops, giving the system time to stabilize between restart attempts.

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

### Task 5.1: Job Cancellation

**Files Modified:**
- `server/queue/validationQueue.ts` - Added `cancelJob()` function
- `server/modules/validateur/routes.ts` - Added cancel endpoint

**New Function:**
```typescript
export async function cancelJob(jobId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const queue = getValidationQueue();
  const job = await queue.getJob(jobId);

  if (!job) return false;

  const state = await job.getState();

  // Can only cancel waiting or active jobs
  if (state === 'waiting' || state === 'active') {
    await job.remove();
    console.log(`[QUEUE] Job ${jobId} cancelled (state: ${state})`);
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```

**New Endpoint:**
- **Route:** `POST /api/validations/:id/cancel`
- **Auth:** Requires authentication and ownership verification
- **Response:** `{ success: true, message: 'Validation cancelled' }` or error

**Key Features:**
- Only allows cancellation of waiting/active jobs
- Updates validation run status to 'failed' with 'Cancelled by user' message
- Returns appropriate error if job cannot be cancelled

**Rationale:** Users can cancel long-running or accidental validation jobs, improving user experience and resource management.

---

### Task 5.2: Live Preview During Processing

**Files Modified:**
- `server/queue/validationWorker.ts` - Store preview in Redis
- `server/modules/validateur/routes.ts` - Added preview endpoint

**Worker Enhancement:**
```typescript
// Store first 10 issues in Redis for live preview
if (validationResults.length > 0) {
  const preview = validationResults.slice(0, 10);
  const redis = getRedisClient();
  await redis.set(
    `validation:preview:${validationRunId}`,
    JSON.stringify(preview),
    'EX',
    600 // Expire after 10 minutes
  );
}
```

**New Endpoint:**
- **Route:** `GET /api/validations/:id/preview`
- **Auth:** Requires authentication and ownership verification
- **Response:** `{ issues: [...] }` with PHI redaction applied

**Key Features:**
- Preview contains first 10 validation issues
- Stored in Redis with 10-minute expiry
- PHI redaction applied based on user preferences
- Returns empty array if no preview available

**Rationale:** Users can see preliminary results while validation is still processing, improving transparency and user experience.

---

### Task 5.3: Batch Upload Support

**File:** `server/modules/validateur/routes.ts`

**New Endpoints:**

1. **POST /api/files/batch**
   - Accepts up to 10 CSV files
   - Returns array of file IDs and count
   - Uses multer `upload.array("files", 10)`

2. **POST /api/validations/batch**
   - Accepts array of file IDs
   - Creates validation run for each file
   - Returns array of validation IDs and count

**Implementation:**
```typescript
router.post("/api/files/batch", authenticateToken, upload.array("files", 10), async (req, res) => {
  const files = req.files as Express.Multer.File[];
  const fileIds = [];

  for (const file of files) {
    const fileRecord = await storage.createFile({
      originalName: file.originalname,
      fileName: file.filename,
      mimeType: file.mimetype,
      size: file.size.toString(),
      uploadedBy: req.user!.uid,
    });
    fileIds.push(fileRecord.id);
  }

  res.json({ fileIds, count: fileIds.length });
});
```

**Key Features:**
- Uploads limited to 10 files per batch (configurable)
- Each file processed individually with full validation
- Jobs enqueued independently for parallel processing
- Skips invalid files with warning instead of failing entire batch

**Rationale:** Healthcare administrators often have multiple billing files to validate, batch processing significantly improves workflow efficiency.
